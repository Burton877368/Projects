# Y-86 Based 64 Bit CPU

These files were created with and are meant to be loaded by Logisim Evolution. 
The file marked FullCPU_complete.circ is the final working design.
Files are loaded by right-clicking and editing the contents of the ROM on the left side, and then inserting a .o file that is converted from Y-86 code.
The output panels at the bottom of the circuit show what is in each register.
